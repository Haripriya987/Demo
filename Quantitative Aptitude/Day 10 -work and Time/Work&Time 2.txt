5)If 10 people can do a job in 20 days ,then 20 people with twice the efficiency can do the same job in 
Total work Measurement => 10*20 =>200
 Then, 20*2*x = 200
40x =200
x=5 
So 20 people with twice the efficiency can do the same job in  5 days.

6)If 72 men can build a wall of 280 m length in 21 days. How many men could take 18 days to build a similar type of wall of length 100 m?
30	10	18	28
For one day 280 m wall required is => 72*21/280
For one day 100 m wall required is  => x*18/100
72*21/280 =x*18/100
x  =>  72*21*100/18*280
x =>30


7)12 workers can do a piece of work in 300 days.At the end of 150 days, the number of workers employed is doubled .So in how many more days will the work be completed?
Total work  =>12*300  =>3600 
After 150 days the work completed is 12*150 => 1800
Remaining work is 1800 .Now, employees are doubled
So 12*2 *D=1800
  D=75 days  are needed to complete remaining work

8)seventy five men are employeed to lay down a railway line in 3 months.Due to certain emergency conditions , the work was to be finished in 18 days .How many more men should be employed  to complete the work in the desired time?
Total work is =>75*3*30 
To finish in 18 days  No of employees need is  18*x=75*3*30
				        X=375
Already 75 employees there we need 300 more employees


9)If 4 men or 8 women can do a piece of work in 15 days ,in how many  days can 6 men and 12 women do the same piece of work
Here we take  1M=2W
So the work in Men Days =>4*15 =>60 W units
Now 6M +12 W complete in no of days
so 12W => 6M
Then,  6M+6M =>12M *x =60
x=> 5days


10)3 men and 4 boys can complete a piece of work in 12 days .4 men and 3 Boys can do the same work in 10 days. Then 2 men and 3 boys can finish the work in number of days?
36M+48B = 40M+30B
18B=4M  =>1M=4.5B
 Total work in BUnits is  =>18+3 =>21*10  =>210Bunits
Now,
2M +3B  =>9B+3B  =>12B  
No of days required is 210/12  =>17.5 days or 35/2 Days 


11)If 10 men complete a piece of work in 30 days , how many men are required to complete the same in 25 days?
Total  work => 10*30  =>300
x*25 =>300
 x=>12 Men

12)Shubam can do 25% of work in 10 days.How many days will he take to complete a work equal to 5 times this work ?
So to complete the work he requires 40 days
For 5 times equal work completes in  =>40*5 =>200 days

13)10 men can dig a hole in 18 days .After 6 days ,5 more men joined .After how many days the remaining work would be completed?
Total work => 10*18 =>180 units
After 6 days means =>  10*6 =>60 units are completed
Remaining 120 units are left
(10+5)*x=120
15*x  =120
x=8 days are required to complete the remaining work


14)18 men working 8 hours a day can complete a work in 5 days .Working at a rate of 6 hours a day , the number of men required to finish the work in 10 days is : 

Here 18*8*5 = x*6*10
Solving we get x =>12 Men required to complete the remaining work.
