1)5km/hr =?(conversion)
5*5/18 =>25/18 m/s

2)An athelete runs 200 metres race in 24 sseconds.His speed in km/hr

200/24  => 50/6*18/5  => 30Km/hr

3)If a man covers 100 km in 10 hours, then how much time would he take to cover 150 km distance at the same speed?

15Km/hr speed

4)A man covers a particular distance in 10 hours at aspeed of 20kmph.If he increases his speed by 50% then in what time would he take to cover the same distance?

6.66 hours

5)If a man walks 20km at 5 km/hr, he will be late by 40 minutes .If he walks at 8 km/hr ,how early from the fixed time will he reach?
Intial time is 4H+2/3H => 14/3 hrs

Next one is 20/8 =>  5/2 hrs

difference is 14/3-5/2  =>28-15/6  =>13/6  hrs early

6)A boy is late by 9 minutes if he walks to school at a speed of 4 km/hr.If he walks at the rate of 5 km/hr , he arrives 9 minutes early.The distance to this school is 

Distance=s1*s2(t1+t2)/s2-s1
               => 4*5(9+9)/5-4
               =>  20*81/60  => 6 km
             
7)A train covers a distance between station A and station B in 45 minutes .If the speed of the train is reduced by 5 km/hr ,then the same distance is covered in 48 minutes.The distance between Station A and B is
speed => x/45/60 => 4x/3 kmph

speed reduced by 5 km/hr => x/4x/3 -5 = 48/60  => 60 km

8)Two persons ride towards each other from two places 55 km apart ,one riding at 12 km/hr and the other at 10 km/hr .In what time will they be 11 km apart?
Relative speed => 12+10 =>22 km/hr
noe distance between them is 55-11=44 km/hr
44/22 => 2km/hr


9)The  distance between two cities A and B is 330 km.A train starts from A at 8 am and travels towards B at 60km/hr Another train starts from B at 9 am and travel towards A at 75 km/hr .At what time do they meet?
common factor is  of 60 ,75 is 300
A reach at 300 km at 1 pm
similarly B reach at 1 pm
at 1 pm

10)A bus moving at a speed of 45 km/hr overtakes a truck 150 metres ahead going in the same direction in 30 seconds .The speed of the truck is 

150/30 * 18/5  = 45-x  => 27 kmph
