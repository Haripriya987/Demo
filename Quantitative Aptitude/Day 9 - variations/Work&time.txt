1) A can do a piece of work in 12 days and B  in 15 Days.They can work together for 5 days and then B left .The days taken by A to finish the remaining work is
A's work  is 12 days
B's work is 15 days
LCM of 12,15  =>60
A can do 60/12 => 5 units
B can do 60/15 =>  4 units
In 5 days they both completed 45 units.
Still 15 units left . So A alone complete remaining work in 3 days 


2)A and B can do a piece of work in 20 days .A alone can do it in 24 days then in how many days can B alone do it
A and B can do in 20 days
A alone can do in 24 days
B can do in  x days
1/24+x=1/20
x=1/20-1/24
x= 6-5/120
x=1/120 
so B alone can do  in 120 days.

3)A,B and C can do a work separately in 16,32 and 48 days respectively .Total time taken by A,B and C together to finish the job?
LCM of 16,32,48  is  96 units
A can do 6 units per day
B can do  3 units per day
C can do 2 units per day
A+B+C  =6+3+2 =>11  =>  96/11 => 8.7 days 

4)Two pipes can fill a tank with water in 15 and 12 hours respectively and a third pipe can empty it in 4 hours.If the pipes be opened in order at 8,9, and 11 am respectively, the tank will be emptied at

LCM of 15,12,6  =>60
So Rate of work by pipe1=>4
	               pipe2=>5
                    Third pipe =>15 
So workdone in one hour => 4+5-15 => -6 
At time  8(pipe)    9(p1+p2)   10(p1+p2)      11
                     4                4+5          4+5             4+5-6
so, 8+9+10 =>4+9+9  => 22 
22/6 =>  3 hours 40 minutes
11+ 3 hours 40 minutes => At 2.40 pm tank will be empty
