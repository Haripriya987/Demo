It is a preview feature in java 15 version.
The concept of Sealed class and Interfaces restricts that which class and interface which extend or implement them.
It allows to have more control over their sub classes and interfaces.

//Sample code

sealed class A   permits B,C{
}
 non-sealed  class B extends A{
}
final class  c extends A{
}
class D extends  B{
}

If sealed class permits the classes then it must extend that sealed class.
The classes which are inheriting from the sealed class must have sealed ,non-sealed or final.
Any of them it should have.Otherwise it will throw an error.
sealed class can also extend other classes and also implement interfaces also.

eg:sealed class extends Demo implements interfaceA permits B,C

The main idea behind this sealed classes is if we want to restrict  the subclasses for a particular class then make it class  as sealed.
