Javafx is a framework for Developing GUI based applications uaing java.
It is a open Source Framework.
To run this javafx applications we have to download and install javafx in our system.
After that we have to use the jarfiles  for each appliaction independently.
we use reference library of these jar files in our application.
{
    "java.project.referencedLibraries": [
        "lib/**/*.jar",
        "c:\\path to lib\\javafx.base.jar",
        "c:\\path to lib\\javafx.controls.jar",
        "c:\\path to lib\\javafx.fxml.jar",
        "c:\\path to lib\\javafx.graphics.jar",
        "c:\\path to lib\\javafx.media.jar",
        "c:\\path to lib\\javafx.swing.jar",
        "c:\\path to lib\\javafx.web.jar",
        "c:\\path to lib\\javafx-swt.jar"
    ]
}
It is important step.Otherwise we are not able to run our application.
In jdk 8 this is inbuilt.If we have JDK 8 in our system then no need to install this javafx.
After that to compile and run this we have to use this in our IDE "--add-modules-  javafx.controls,javafx.fxml" .
It is advanced when compared with awt,swing.
we can develop dynamic GUI applications using this javafx.
Some of the key features of Javafx are:
Java API
FXML sceneBuilder
WebView
Canvas API
SwingInteroperability
Built in UI Controls as CSS
High Performanced Media Engine
