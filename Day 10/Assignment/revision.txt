Basically two types of errors are there 
checked Exceptions -Compile time errors
Unchecked Exceptions -Runtime errors
Object is the root for all the classes in java.It can be inherited default if it does not inheriting any of  the class.
In checked exceptions we have to necessarily check and handle the exceptions otherwise it will abort the program
Exception is a parent  class for all exceptions .we can also use custom exception that have to be extended from a Exception class
Java does not support multiple inheritance.the reason  is it leads an ambiguity to the compiler so, it does not support.
explaining  with a scenario
if we are having three classes A,B,C  if A haves a method show .B also have a method show.If C is extending both classes then we create an object for c call the method show .Which show method has to execute.So it leads to ambiguity to compiler. This is the reason java does not support multiple Inheritance.
It is also called as Diamond problem.

OOPs
There are mainly four concepts in ObjectOrientedProgramming
1.Abstraction
Hiding inner details presenting only essentials details
100% abstraction can be achieved by using interfaces.
Default all the methods in interface are abstract.
it can also be achieved using abstract classes also but it is from 0 to 100%

2.Encapsulation 
Wrapping of all the variables,methods and data into a class is called as Encapsulation.

3.Inheritance
It gives the idea of reusablity.by using inheritance we can inherit the methods and variables of a parent class to child class.
There are different types of them
single Inheritance    Hybrid inheritance  Multilevel Inheitance
These three are supported by java.

4.Polymorphism
Ability to take more than one form.
Two Types are there 
compiletime polymorphism:It can be achieved using method overloading
 runtime polymorphism:It can be achieved using method overriding
