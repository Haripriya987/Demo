-----Principles Of Object-Oriented Programming----- 
Principles of Object-Oriented programming are
 1.Abstraction. 
2.Encapsulation. 
3.Inheritance. 
4.Polymorphism. 
Abstraction: 
Abstraction means hiding internal details and showing the required things.
Encapsulation:
 Encapsulation is the process of grouping data in a single section.
Inheritance :
Inheritance means designing an object or a class by re-using the properties of the existing class and object.
Inheritance is same as specialization.
Polymorphism:
Polymorphism is a concept in which we can execute a single operation in different ways.
polymorphism is same as generalization.

Class VS Object 
Object is defined in terms of its properties and behaviour.
Operation of behaviours will affect the properties. 
Anything in the world can be defined in the terms of properties and behaviour. 
For a single class we can have many objects. 
Multiple number of objects can be created by one single class   
In java there is an area inside main memory which is known as method area which contains all the methods.
The definitions of the will be present inside the heap, as the objects will be based on the definitions so the objects are also present in heap.

//sample program for creating class and objects
class Television{
  private int channel;  
  private int volume;  
public void changechannel() 
 public void changevolume()
 } 
class test { 
 public static void main(String args[]){
   Television t=new Television();
   t.changechannel(10);  
    }
 }
