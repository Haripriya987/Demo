-----Generalization VS specialization------
 Common thing in Generalisation and Specialization is they are in the form of Hierarchy      
  It is Like a Parent Class and Child Class(or)
Base Class and Derived Class(or) 
Super Class and Sub Class. 
Generalization :
In Generalization group of classes are referred with Super class with single name.
Generalization means Bottom Up.
In Generalization A Super Class Is made by Grouping Multiple Sub Classes. 
Generalization is achieved using Interfaces.
For achieving Generalization Abstract Classes are Used. 
For Example
*Generalization
1.Smart Phone - I phone ,Samsung,Vivo
2.Vehicle -Car,Bike,Ship
3.Shape -Triangle,Rectangle,Circle
Specialization:
In Specialization a new Sub Class is Generated by borrowing the features of existing concrete class and adding new features to it. Specialisation means Top Down.
In specialisation a new Class is derived from an existing Super Class.
 Specialization is achieved using Inheritance. 
Specialization Examples
I Phone X -> I Phone XS         
2.Innova -> Fortuner         
3.Circle -> Cylinder         
4.Guitar -> Electric Guitar

--------- Inheritance-------
Inheritance is the process of acquiring features of an existing Class into a New Class. 
A Class will have Properties and Method. 

For Example A cylinder can acquire all the properties of circle Plus it can have extra feature.
 Where we can write a class cylinder inheriting from class circle      A Cuboid can Acquire All the Propertied of A Rectangle Plus extra feature .
Example Program :
class Circle {       
private double radius;       
public Circle( ){            
radius =0.0;       
}       
public double area(){
}       
public double perimeter(){
} 
}
 class Cylinder extends Circle {       
private double height;       
public Cylinder(){           
height=0.0;      
 }       
public double volume()
{
} 
}
 class test {       
public static void main(){        
Circle c1=new Circle();        
Cylinder c2=new Cylinder();       
}
 }  
Circle and Cylinder are the two classes  where circle class is having radius and Cylinder Class acquire the property(radius) of circle with an extra property that is height.     
Cylinder is the Extension of Circle.     
extends is the keyword used for Inheritance.     
Circle Class Is Parent Class.    
Cylinder Class is the Derived Class, Derived Class is also known as Specialised Class.    
In the given example upon the object c1 and c2 the constructors are called automatically.
In object c1 methods area and perimeter are called  
  In object c2 methods area. 

--------Constructors in Inheritance-----
Constructors are the methods of class which are automatically called when an object is created.    
Constructors are executed from Top to Bottom Class.    
To make the child class object Pirstly the parent class constructor must be created.
Example Program
class Parent {   
 public Parent(){    
  System.out.println(“Parent Constructor”);    
} 
} 
 class Child extends Parent {    
public Child()    
{       
System.out.println(“Child Constructor”);    
}
 }
 class Grandchild extends Child{
    public Grandchild(){       
System.out.println(“Grand Child Constructor”);    
}
 }
 class inheritanceDemo 
{   
Grandchild g=new Grandchild(); 
} 
In the given example Parent Class have its constructor where “parent constructor” is executed, and Child Class have its constructor where “Child Constructor”, is executed and Grandchild Class have its constructor where “Grandchild Constructor” is executed. In the given example program if a Grandchild class object is created then as we know Grandchild class inherits Child class constructor and Child class inherits Parent class constructor so the Grandchild object first executes the top most class then level by level.
