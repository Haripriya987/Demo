Data Hiding
Usually data is hidden and the operations are made visible and operations or methods are performed over the data 

class Rectangle{
   public int length;   
   public int breadth;   
  public int area() {    
 return length*breadth;
   }  
 public int perimeter (){  
   return 2*(length+breadth);   
}
  class test {  
  public static void main(String args[])  
 {   
  Rectangle r=new Rectangle();  
  }
 }

In above example there is given two data members length and breadth which are the properties of the class. 
And the area and perimeter is the method of the class where both the methods are performing the operations on the given data. 
For hiding the data, the data members will have the stricter (private) success modifier. 
So, when the data is made private, we can’t access that data outside the class.  
Types of Properties
Read and writable property. 
getLength() method will allow us to read the property 
setLength() method will allow us to write the property . 
Read only property. 
When there is no modification to the property then read only property is used.  
Write only property
Only set method is used for writing the property where no get method is used. 
Constructors 
 A method is required for Initialization of properties at the time of construction of an object, this method is known as constructor. 
Constructor is a method of class called when an object is created. Every class will have a default constructor provided by java compiler. 
Constructor will not have any return type.  
There are two types of constructors  
1. parameterized 
2. Non-parameterized. 
Non-parameterized constructors is a replacement for default constructors. 
Constructors can be overloaded.
we can create any number of constructors.
