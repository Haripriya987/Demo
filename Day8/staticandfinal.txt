----Final Members-----
Values of final variables are fixed, once the value is assigned then it can’t be modified. 
Final variables are written in capital letters. 
Final variable can be initialised while declaring the variable, or it can be initialised in a static block, or else it can be initialised inside constructor of a class. 
As constructors can be overloaded then the Linal variable must be initialised in every constructor. 
Final method cannot be overridden.
